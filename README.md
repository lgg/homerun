HomeRun replaces the manual GitHub self-hosted runner setup process with a unified desktop app and terminal UI. Authenticate with GitHub once, pick a repository, and launch runners with a single click. HomeRun handles download, registration, process management, log streaming, and resource monitoring — everything the official docs make you do by hand.

HomeRun runs on **macOS**, **Windows**, and **Linux**. Login startup is built in on macOS and Windows; Linux service integration is still manual.

## Features

- **One-click runner setup** — no shell scripts, no copy-pasting tokens
- **Device Flow authentication** — log in with your GitHub account via browser; no PAT required
- **Batch runner creation** — spin up multiple runners for the same repo in one step with live progress
- **Unified dashboard** — monitor all runners across all repos in one place
- **Live log streaming** — tail runner output in real time from the runner detail view
- **Job tracking** — current job progress with step-by-step status, estimated completion, and full job history per runner
- **Runner metrics** — CPU/RAM polling with WebSocket lifecycle events for immediate dashboard refresh
- **Two run modes** — app-managed (daemon child) or background service (launchd)
- **Auto-restart** — crashed runners recover automatically (up to 3 attempts)
- **Smart repo discovery** — scan local workspace directories or your GitHub account for repos that use self-hosted runners
- **Terminal UI** — k9s-inspired TUI with info header, context-sensitive keybindings (F1-F4 tabs), repo search, and in-app login via Device Flow
- **CLI mode** — scriptable `homerun --no-tui` commands with colored output for automation
- **Cross-platform** — macOS (launchd), Windows (Registry Run + named-pipe IPC), and Linux; desktop notifications use the Tauri notification API
- **Pre-commit hooks** — enforces `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`, conventional commits, and Prettier on every commit

## Architecture

```

   │Run 1│   │Run 2│   │Run N│   (GitHub Actions runner processes)
   └─────┘   └─────┘   └─────┘
```

By default, runners are native child processes of the daemon. Each runner is an instance of the [official GitHub Actions runner binary](https://github.com/actions/runner). Runners can also run inside a Docker container instead — see [Docker Runners](docs/DOCKER_RUNNERS.md). All GitHub communication is outbound HTTPS. No inbound ports needed.

For the full architecture deep-dive (runner lifecycle, state machine, process management, auth flow), see [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

New to self-hosted runners? See [How Self-Hosted Runners Work](docs/SELF_HOSTED_RUNNERS.md) for a primer on runner communication, permissions, security considerations, and what HomeRun automates.

## Quick Start

### Install (macOS — DMG)

1. Download the latest `.dmg` for your architecture from [Releases](https://github.com/lgg/homerun/releases):
   - **Apple Silicon** (M1/M2/M3/M4): `HomeRun_<version>_aarch64.dmg`
   - **Intel**: `HomeRun_<version>_x86_64.dmg`
2. Open the `.dmg` and drag HomeRun to Applications
3. Remove the macOS quarantine flag (required because the app is not yet code-signed):

   ```sh
   xattr -cr /Applications/HomeRun.app
   ```

4. Launch HomeRun — go to Settings > Startup > "Launch at login" to auto-start the daemon

The `.dmg` bundles the `homerund` daemon inside the app. Releases are automated via [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) — every merge to `master` with conventional commits triggers a Release PR with version bumps and changelog.

### Install (macOS — Homebrew)

Homebrew publication is optional and only runs when the repository variable
`HOMEBREW_TAP_REPOSITORY` and the `TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN` secret are configured.
Until a tap is listed in the release notes, install the signed release assets
above instead of assuming an upstream or third-party tap.

### Install (Windows — MSI)

1. Download `HomeRun_<version>_x64-setup.msi` from [Releases](https://github.com/lgg/homerun/releases)
2. Run the installer — it installs HomeRun and the `homerund` daemon
3. Launch HomeRun from the Start Menu — go to Settings > Startup > "Launch at login" to auto-start the daemon through the current user Registry Run entry

### Install (Linux — AppImage / deb)

Download the latest `.AppImage` or `.deb` from [Releases](https://github.com/lgg/homerun/releases). The daemon and TUI are also published as an `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` tarball. Linux login startup is not installed automatically yet; launch `homerund` yourself or configure your preferred user service manager.

### Build from Source

**Prerequisites:** Rust 1.75+ ([rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs)), Node.js 20+. On macOS: Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`). On Windows: Visual Studio Build Tools with C++ workload.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lgg/homerun.git
cd homerun
```

**macOS:**

```sh
make setup        # checks prerequisites, builds daemon + TUI, installs frontend deps
```

**Windows:**

```powershell
# Daemon + TUI (release binaries)
cargo build --release -p homerund -p homerun

# MSI installer (copies the daemon sidecar, builds the frontend, and packages the MSI)
copy target\release\homerund.exe apps\desktop\src-tauri\binaries\homerund-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe
cd apps\desktop
npm install
npx tauri build
# Output: apps\desktop\src-tauri\target\release\bundle\msi\HomeRun_<version>_x64_en-US.msi
```

**Any platform (manual build):**

```sh
# Daemon + TUI
cargo build --release -p homerund -p homerun

# Desktop app (requires Node.js — builds DMG on macOS, MSI + NSIS on Windows)
cargo build --release -p homerund
cp target/release/homerund$(rustc -vV | grep host | cut -d' ' -f2 | sed 's/^/-/') apps/desktop/src-tauri/binaries/
cd apps/desktop && npm install && npx tauri build
```

### Run

```sh
# Start the daemon (required by both the TUI and desktop app)
make dev                # or: ./target/release/homerund

# Launch the TUI (in another terminal)
make tui                # or: ./target/release/homerun

# Launch the desktop app (in another terminal)
make desktop            # or: cd apps/desktop && npm run tauri dev

# CLI mode (no interactive UI — useful for scripts)
homerun --no-tui list
```

On Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
.\target\release\homerund.exe         # start daemon
.\target\release\homerun.exe          # launch TUI
.\target\release\homerun.exe --no-tui list   # CLI mode
```

> **Note:** The desktop app release bundles the daemon inside the app (DMG on macOS, MSI on Windows). When building from source, start the daemon separately before launching the desktop app.

Run `make help` (macOS) to see all available commands.

## CLI Usage

The `--no-tui` flag disables the interactive terminal UI and prints plain text output instead. This is useful for scripting, automation, and quick status checks.

```sh
# List all runners with status, mode, and CPU usage
homerun --no-tui list

# Show overall status (daemon, auth, runner counts, system metrics)
homerun --no-tui status

# Scan a local workspace for repos using self-hosted runners
homerun --no-tui scan ~/workspace

# Scan your GitHub repos remotely (requires authentication)
homerun --no-tui scan --remote

# Combine local and remote scanning
homerun --no-tui scan ~/workspace --remote

# Authenticate and manage runners
homerun --no-tui login
homerun --no-tui add build-1 --repo owner/repo
homerun --no-tui add build --repo owner/repo --count 3
homerun --no-tui start build-1
homerun --no-tui stop build-1
homerun --no-tui restart build-1
homerun --no-tui set-mode build-1 app
homerun --no-tui remove build-1
homerun --no-tui logout

# Manage the daemon and login startup
homerun --no-tui daemon start
homerun --no-tui daemon stop
homerun --no-tui daemon restart
homerun --no-tui daemon autostart status
homerun --no-tui daemon autostart enable
homerun --no-tui daemon autostart disable
```

## FAQ / Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>Daemon won't start / "socket already exists"</strong></summary>

**macOS/Linux:** A stale socket file may exist from a previous crash. Remove it and try again:

```sh
rm ~/.homerun/daemon.sock
homerund
```

**Windows:** Named pipes are cleaned up automatically when the process exits. If the daemon reports the pipe is active, another instance may still be running. Check with `tasklist | findstr homerund`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Authentication fails / "token expired"</strong></summary>

Re-authenticate with Device Flow from the TUI or desktop app, or run `homerun --no-tui login`. For a PAT, grant only the repository and runner-administration permissions you need. HomeRun stores the token in `~/.homerun/auth.json` with owner-only permissions on Unix; `homerun --no-tui logout` removes it.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Runner stuck in "Registering" state</strong></summary>

This usually means the GitHub API registration token request failed or timed out. Check:

1. Your GitHub token is valid and has the `repo` scope
2. You have admin access to the target repository (required by GitHub to register self-hosted runners)
3. The repository hasn't hit the [self-hosted runner limit](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners#self-hosted-runner-limits)

Stop the runner and try creating a new one.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Runner exits immediately after starting</strong></summary>

Check the runner logs in `~/.homerun/logs/` for details. Common causes:

- Another runner is already using the same work directory
- The runner binary is corrupted — delete `~/.homerun/cache/` to force a fresh download
- macOS Gatekeeper is blocking the runner binary — run `xattr -cr ~/.homerun/cache/`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Desktop app shows "Cannot connect to daemon"</strong></summary>

The daemon must be running before launching the desktop app or TUI. Start it with:

```sh
homerund
```

Or enable "Launch at login" in Settings > Startup to have it start automatically via launchd on macOS or the current-user Registry Run entry on Windows. Linux startup is currently configured manually.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>"Background Items Added" notification with cryptic name</strong></summary>

macOS Ventura+ shows a "Background Items Added" notification when HomeRun registers the daemon as a background service. Since the app is not yet code-signed, macOS displays a hash identifier instead of "HomeRun". This is cosmetic and doesn't affect functionality.

You can manage background items in **System Settings > General > Login Items & Extensions**.

Code signing is tracked in [#49](https://github.com/lgg/homerun/issues/49) — once resolved, the notification will show "HomeRun" properly.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>CI workflows fail on self-hosted runners</strong></summary>

Self-hosted runners don't come with pre-installed tools like GitHub-hosted runners do. Your CI workflows will fail if the runner host is missing the tools your project needs (compilers, runtimes, package managers, etc.). Make sure all required build tools are installed on the host machine and available in PATH, then restart the runner service.
